My MCP server creates a Project Timer tool(Base tier) that lets me track how long I spend on different tasks. The tool can start a timer for a named task and stop the timer later to calculate how much time has passed. The start time is saved to a local file, so the timer doesn’t reset if the server restarts.
For this new assignment, I added an alert feature to the project. The alert notifies the user when a timer is started or stopped, making it clearer when tracking begins and ends. This helps prevent forgetting to stop a timer and makes the tool easier to use overall. The Project Timer is useful for tracking work time on homework, design projects, or coding assignments.
