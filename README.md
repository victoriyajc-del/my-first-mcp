Base Tier 
My MCP server creates a Project Timer tool that lets me track how long I spend on different tasks. The tool can start a timer for a named task and stop the timer later to calculate how much time passed. The start time is saved to a local file, so the timer doesn’t reset if the server restarts. This is useful for tracking work time on homework, design projects, or coding assignments.
